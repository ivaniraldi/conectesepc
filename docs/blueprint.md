## Style Guidelines:

- Dark color scheme with a primary color of deep blue (#30475E) to convey reliability and professionalism.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222831), a desaturated version of the primary to enhance readability in a dark mode.
- Accent color: Yellow-gold (#F05454), an analogous color used to highlight key elements like the WhatsApp button and CTAs, drawing the user's attention without disrupting the calm tone.
- 'Poppins', a sans-serif, will be used for both headings and body text, due to its neutral and modern appearance.
- Use minimalist, modern icons in white or the accent color for key sections and interactive elements.
- Design a clean, single-page layout with clear sections for each setup, 'About Us,' and the contact form. Prioritize readability and easy navigation.
- Use Framer Motion for website animations to enhance the user experience. Implement hero parallax effects for a visually appealing and engaging site. The hero includes a CTA to buy.
